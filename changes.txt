v0.1: THE BEGINNING

There's nothing much of this mod as of now as I try to wrap my head around actually coding this and try to find all the reports in legit all types of Sordland runs but I'll get there (or give up trying).
Right now I am really just doing the basics where I am changing all the names of the parties and removing old ones not needed, adding an electoral threshold, the usual. We'll see if you get to see this first message since if this secondary branch crashes you'll never see this development log!
